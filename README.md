An unfinished entry for 2023 Scream Jam, created with GDevelop.

### Brainstorm
Working remote in a snowy cabin, you're snowed in and have to chop trees for wood for warmth. You also forage for mushrooms in the woods. As days pass you have to fight off goblins, eventually dying to them. As the credits role, a newscast plays about a crazed man who murdered several attempted rescuers after surving on toxic mushrooms.

The mechanics of chopping the trees for firewood also teach the mechanics of combat; and as you grow more crazy the list of tasks you have to complete each day get more insane and numerous.
